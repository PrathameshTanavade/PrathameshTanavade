## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github profile.

I am an aspiring Data Engineer who is also driven by curiosity. I have utilised  python, pandas, pyspark, mongodb ,SQL etc in implementing projects that I think are somewhat reflective of actual workload in a professional environment.

Below is the structure of my **Data-Engineering** Repositories
